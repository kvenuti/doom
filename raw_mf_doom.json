Hope not\nor I might throw up, to lose the recipe\nMan, I sure can stay inside my head\nand play dead, like Night of the Living White Dreads\nwho want to be angry, but then seem frightened\nSort of reminiscent of Clash of the Teen Titans\nI used to have a girlfriend, but it was time to go\nwhen she was trying to show - how much hate\nshe could still taste from things that happened awhile ago\nIt was wearing thin, but I can be a trifle slow\nEspecially on a tourniquet that should've stymied her flow\nI never earned her full bliss, it went wrong\nbut my permagrin is quite strong like 500,000 miles long\nCry on, because I'm like the swan\nAnd if this mic is on\nI guess I might stay on long enough to write this song\nYeah, right! It's hype, get your clothes girl\nI don't have the time or mood to make your toes curl\nNo more open mics? no sir\nEver since you laid the cold hurt, it's a ghost world\nNEXT, a strict regiment of sets on the bowflex\nChromium to mold flesh and wheat grass to show the rest\nMeditation and some slow stretching\nLet the mind go to rest when necessary, speaking of which, no sex\nIt's a time to heal, not a time to hate\nand don't try to keep it real in such a sad state\nJust be depressed for a sec, and if it ends late\nbe like yey! I made through until the next day\nThe best say, you can't stay in one place too long\nThe rest say, you're gay if you still like those old love songs\nThe test press day is now, I best press play and taste the sound\njust in case I see a queen and want to checkmate her style\nAnd we could just embrace, or ride out\nBut right now, I'm still looking for love inside my hideout\nIt's really nothing to cry about\nbut when I'm out of patience with my mistakes\nIt's like, \"God get the Whiteout!\"\n\n[MF DOOM]\nWhat a messy fuss, it happens to the best of us\nLove/hate to raise the heart rate up to your chest to bust\nand leave you with just enough stress to cuss\nOoh trouble; two's a couple, three's treacherous\n... and got you open like the high seas\nHoping like deez for the squeeze on live G's\n... jive turkeys!\nThey lucky if they survive the depths of hell, it's murky\nJerky, come on work with me\nSee how she's twerking the skirt with tits perky\nA flirt with a smirk that could body you in one shot glance\nand let 'em rot, I'm like \"Not a chance, hot pants!\"\nRun feet, and keep from off front street\nThat sizzle like the blunt heat, with business that's for under sheets\nCreep on secret missions, peep it\nor else be in some deep shit, with more fishes to sleep with"}]}

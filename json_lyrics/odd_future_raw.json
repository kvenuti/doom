always said, \"Fuck shit\"--Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one--Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some--See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's--And I be gassin'

tempers, and well--I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself--These fucking rappers got stylist, it's cause they can't think for themselves--See, they don't have an identity, so

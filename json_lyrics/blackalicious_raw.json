silhouetted superbly\nCurved indeed, she started staring in my direction\nLuring and urging seductively, body language instructing me\nI offered her a drink instead she took a cup of tea\nAnd then I lied about my luxury lifestyle\nI said \"So who you be? You looking kind of tight, gal\nI would love to see you in a nightgown\"\nShe said \"They call me the Dragon Queen and I come from Tibet\nI'm calm in the face of pressure and you'll never see me

said the description that I fit\nWas that of the Chosen One who'd go beyond\nThen slipped a concoction in my drink\nImmediately set my consciousness adrift\u0085\n\nNow I'm in that zone dwelling, I woke in a warehouse tied to a chair\nWith an abundance of flair surrounding me in a circular angle\nGlared up at the Dragon Queen's lair, wasn't imagining a thing\nHer steps on the stairs had a magic Gleam, glowed brightly\nTo prepare me for my journey a Sword was hovering towards me\nPlus garlic from the Keepers of the Gate who bore all the secrets and take\nCare of trespassers, but at last it's prophesied that I would gain\nAccess to a cultural dynasty buried and seize and capture the Scroll\nMassive helicopters patrolled the rooftops, strapped in\nBegan travelling into the darkness, knew not of what awaited\nThought of a way to get out of it, just then the bottom gave way\nI began falling and gave it ten seconds, pulled the cord on my parachute\nLanded surrounded by a herd of wild barracudas, lions\nThe sounds of the wild kingdom piercing like a siren\nWas I entering near the mere mortal life span's end?\nDefiantly I stood boldly as they began closing in\nAnd time seemed to be moving rapidly just then\u0085\n\n\"Whole house freeze!\"\n\nJust then I pulled the Sword and somehow\nIt affected all the creatures as they stepped back and bowed\nAnd the same Glow that I seen in the Sword I seen in the eyes of the Lion\nWho began leading me in a specific direction as if trying to tell me something\nJust over the horizon, the same creatures who had been described\nAppeared in statue form but their eyes scoped\nAnd as I approached the gate they began to break open and cried\n\"AFTER YEARS WE HAVE FINALLY BEEN AWAKENED!\"\nThe assault was on, I got knocked to the ground by one\nShocked in an unorthodox form boxing\nThrowing an abnormal proportion of body blows, karate chops\nAnd drop kicks, plunged struggling deeper into the swamp\nThen I grabbed my Sword, the garlic put it around my neck\nSaw that it was draining all of their energy and then with a swing\nOff with their heads!\nThe gates slowly and mysteriously opened\nSo curiously I moseyed in with intensity focusing on my objective\nSpider webs the size of king-size beds\nFell into a secret passage not knowing to where it lead\nJust then the same Light beamed brightly and in the distance\nAt that instance, lo and behold, the hidden Scroll!\nAnd just as I thought my mission was over\nI could feel the Dragon Queen breathing heavily over my shoulder\n\nAs she began to transform and metamorphosise\nShe took on an assortment of legs, arms, heads and eyes\nAnd sprouted two horns and began to breathe fire\nSo once again I grabbed my trusty Sword but to my astonishment\nShe burned it to a crisp turned and grasped the Scroll\nAnd exited much faster than secreted gas, I'm gasping\nClasp full of flames cast in my direction\nI saw my whole life flash and the possibility of death\nAnd a casket passed into the ground, pound for pound, astounding\nHow could I survive and last another round inside this madness?\n\n\"Whole house freeze!\"", "Making Progress": "\nChorus:\nWe keep

communication\nThey are shards of metal\nDropped from eight story windows\nThey are waterfalls and gas leaks\nAged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf\nThe tools of a trade\nBarbers barred, barred of barters\nCatch phrases and misunderstandings\nBut they are not what I feel when I am alone\nSurrounded by everything and nothing\nAnd there isn't a word or phrase to be caught\nA verse to be recited\nA man to de-fill my being in those moments\nI am blankness, the contained center of an \"O\"\nThe pyramidic containment of an \"A\"\nI stand in the middle of all that I have learned\nAll that I have memorized\nAll that I've known by heart\nUnable to reach any of it\nThere is no sadness\nThere is no bliss\nIt is a forgotten memory\nA memorable escape route that only is found by not looking\nThere, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless\nThey are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness\nBut then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence\nWho else has learned to sling these ancient ideas\nlike dead rats held by their tails\nso as not to infect this newly oiled skin\nI can think of nothing heavier than an airplane\nI can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal\nI can think of nothing less likely to fly\nThere are no wings more weighted\nI too have felt a heaviness\nThe stare of man guessing at my being\nYes I am homeless\nA homeless man making offerings to the after-future\nSculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles\nA nation unified in exhale\nA cloud of smoke\nA native pipe ceremony\nAll the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps\nSnow covered mountains\nLipsticks smeared and shriveled\nOfferings to an afterworld\nTattoo guns and plastic wrappers\nBroken zippers and dead eyed dolls\nIt's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me\nI have seeded a forest of myself\nLittle books from tall trees\nIt matters not what this paper be made of\nGive me notebooks made of human flesh\nDried on steel hooks and nooses\nMake uses of use, uses of us\nIt's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me\nI have seeded a forest of myself\nLittle books from tall trees\nOn bended knee\nProstrate before an altered tree\nI've made the forest suit me\nTables and chairs\nPapers and prayers\nMatter vs. spirit, through meditation\nI program my heart to beat breakbeats and hum

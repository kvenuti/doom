I've seen a lot of hypocrites, religious fakers\n\nDeacon whore mongers and offer takers\nWhen I turned thirteen I thought church was fake\nI took all I could take so I took a little break\nI went to the world, bought a geri curl\nAnd some crack to slice so I can do my own thang\nThe street life I didn't understand good\nSo I started gangbangin' to prove my manhood\nYeah, had fun packin' the gun\nThe baddest kid on the block was a Christian son\nWent to the county jail not once but twice\nGamblin' with my life with the dealin' dice\n{*chicken cluck*}\n\n[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]\nGod

in the day from Palmdale to L.A\nThey got beef wit me homie up until this day\nTo make a long story short I stepped out the tub\nWalked around the corner to the local night club\nSittin' at a table, just doin' my thang\nThis when I got approached by this rival gang\nHis gang and my gang just got into it (just got into it)\nI tried to explain I didn't do it (uh)\nI told ya bro, since '94\nI been

robbin' me (robbin' me)\nThe things that they took from me wasn't nothin' major\n\nWallet, walkman, cheap little pager\nThey took my food stamps, took my knife\nTook me and tried to take my life {*chicken cluck*}\nI tried to fight back but my efforts was useless\nAin't know need to makin' up excuses, hey man\nI was on the ground (ground) gettin' beat down (down)\nEight different people kickin' me around\nI thought about all the bad things I did\nWhen I ran from God as a little bitty kid\nNo sign, no reason, no clue, no warnin'\nNo fair nobody cared, 2 o'clock in the mornin'\nHeavy licks they was layin' on me\nBut at the same time my momma, she was prayin' for me\nLights from the helicopter filled the air\nAnd the police cars came everywhere, uh\nI told Jesus \"I don't deserve You\nBut let me live and I'll serve You\"\nGod has smiled on me\n\n[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]\nGod has (come on y'all) smiled on me\nHe has set me free (can you sing it again?)\nOhhh God has (yeah) smiled on me and He's been good to me\n\n[Outro]\nYeah man, uh, sometimes when I'm drinkin' man\nI think about my close calls, you know what I'm sayin'\nTimes I almost got shot\nTimes I was commitin' crimes, almost got caught by the police\nMan I think about car accidents that never happened\nI think about homeboys I speak to one day\nNext day they catch 50-60 years\nMaybe even rest in peace, you know what I'm sayin'\nSo check this out man, yeah, we still alive, right?\nGod ain't through with us\nSo let's put it down man, stop all this madness\nYou know what I'm sayin'\nGo on take care of some situations we need to take care of\nAnd to all the homeboys that robbed me, hey man I'm still alive\nSo if y'all be so kind, go down there and buy my tape man\nThat'll make up them food stamps y'all

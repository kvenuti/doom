everywhere, uh--I told Jesus \"I don't deserve You--But let me live and I'll serve You\"--God has smiled on me------God has  smiled on me--He has set me free --Ohhh God has  smiled on me and He's been good to me------Yeah man, uh, sometimes when I'm drinkin' man--I think about my close calls, you know what I'm sayin'--Times I almost got shot--Times I was commitin' crimes, almost got caught by the police--Man I think about car accidents that never happened--I think about homeboys I speak to one day--Next day they catch 50-60 years--Maybe even rest in peace, you know what I'm sayin'--So check this out man, yeah, we still alive, right?--God ain't through with us--So let's put it down man, stop all this madness--You know what I'm sayin'--Go on take care of some situations we need to take care of--And to all the homeboys that robbed me, hey man I'm still alive--So if y'all be so kind, go down there and buy my tape man--That'll make up them food stamps y'all took from me right--{*chicken cluck*}------Amazin' grace  how sweet the sound--That saved a wretch like me--I once was lost but now I'm found--Was blind but now I see--I'm tellin' you God has  smiled on me-- He

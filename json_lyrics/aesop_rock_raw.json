yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street\nThe many faces of the various locals that she would meet\nThere was joshua, age 10\nBully of the block\nWho always took her milk money at the morning bus stop\nThere was Mrs. Crabtree, and her poodle\nShe always gave a wave and holler on her weekly trip down to the bingo\nparlor\nAnd she drew\nMen, women, kids, sunsets, clouds\nAnd she drew\nSkyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns\nAlways said hello to passers-by\nThey'd ask her why she passed her time\nAttachin lines to concrete\nBut she would only smile\nNow all the other children living in or near her building\nRan around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants\nThey would say\n\"Hey little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?\"\nLucy would pause, look, grin and say\n\"I'm busy, thank you much\"\nWell, well, one year passed\nAnd believe it or not\nShe covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk,\nAnd she stopped-\n\"Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today??\"\nShe said:\n\"I'm not giving in, I'm finished,\" and walked away\n\n(Chorus: x2)\n1 2 3\nThat's the speed of the seed\nA B C\nThat's the speed of the need\nYou can dream a little

in\nShe traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip\nTraded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks\nAnd she drew\nLittle bobby who would come to sweep the porch\nAnd she drew\nThe mailman, delivered everyday at 4\nLucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day\nBut she found it suitable, and she liked it that way\nShe had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit\nThey would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose\nThey appreciated space and Rico was an artist too\nSo they'd connect on saturdays to share the pictures that they drew\n(Look!)\nNow every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door\nJust one of the neighbors,\nActin nice, although she was a strange girl, really\nSay, \"Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch??\"\nLucy would smile and say \"I'm busy, thank you much\"\nAnd they would make a weird face the second the door shut\nAnd run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was\nAnd lucy knew what people thought but didn't care\nCuz while they spread their rumors through the street\nShe'd paint another masterpiece\n\n(Chorus x2)\n\nLucy was 87, upon her death bed\nAt the senior home, where she had previously checked in\nTraded in the locks and clips for a head rest\nTraded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen\nAnd she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn\nHad a television in the room that she'd never turned on\nLucy pinned up a life worth's of pictures on the wall\nAnd sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all\nNo Rico, he had passed, 'bout 5 years back\nSo the visiting hours pulled in a big flock o' nothin\nShe'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life\nUntil the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside\nAnd she said:\n\"Look, I've never had a dream in my life\nBecause a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued\nI knew what I wanted and did it till it was done\nSo i've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!\"\nWell!\nThe nurse jumped back,\nShe'd never heard Lucy even talk,\n'Specially words like that\nShe walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind\nThen Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures\nAnd she died.\n\n(Chorus x2)\n\n1 2 3...\nA B C..."}, "None Shall Pass": {"Fumes": "\n[Intro]\n\"You ain't shit man, your story's a joke\nYou should

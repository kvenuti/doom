the bed linen\nChillin in front my building with my brother and them\nSpending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them\nWise town and Beat Street, federal relief\nSlowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat\nSticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep\nWith every flavor Now &amp; Later only a dime apiece\nOld timers on the bench playing cards and thangs\nTelling tales about they used to be involved in things\nStart to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out\nOn the phone, call the cops, pick'em up, move'em out\nAnd it's all too common to start wildin\nI'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence\nAnd it's hard to find\nBlock parties in dark lobbies\nFuneral homes packed but only dark bodies\nI can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley\nMarley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall\nSon i been to many places in my space and time\nand whatever my home is, son home is mine.\n\n(chorus)", "Rock N Roll": "\n[Mos Def]\nMake

Cotton you yield.  Your skin peels off your back\nFrom the crack of the whip.  It won't heal.\nYa wish you had a shield 'cause he wields iron,\nSo when you act up, he smokes ya and keeps firing.\nAnd it's tiring.\nForget about recreation.\nOne wrong move and it's death you're facing.\nWhite motha fuckaz got the ball and chain\nOn your leg, and in the form of religion on your brain.\nThey say, \"You the devil.\"\nYou say, \"Who the devil?!?!\"\nSome of us was house niggers.  Some of us was rebels.\nSome tried to get along the best they could.\nAnd didn't nobody use the phrase, \"It's all good!\"\nWould you?  They got you living like a shrew.\nThey throw you pig lips and chicken gizzards.  Then you make a stew.\nThey give us a white Jesus to appease us.\nWe talk among ourselves and hope nobody sees us.\nThey had our brothers beating us. Called us createns plus monkeys.\nThey just junkies mistreating us.\nThe master said, \"If you don't whip 'em,  you're dead!\"\nIt was fucking with his head, but he beat us instead.\nAnd we bled.\nRed blood flowing like a flood.\nThen he'd rape your mother.  Stick her face in the mud.\nThey were ruthless!  If you tried to front, you'd be toothless.\nSome tried to run even though it seemed useless.\nVirginity was torn.  Soon babies was born that was half white.\nAnd now his skin is kind of light.\nYou think you're special, because they let you\nOversee the carnage?

battle was quickly upon me\nInsubordination was reported with no warning\nSmugglers damaged the fleets of prime chief's resulting in immediate retreat\nA hollow victory, I soon defected\nUndetected at first but soon checked for\nI was a spy that fly on the wall that no one ever seems to recognize\nDisguised as a trash-dweller who has no self confidence defeated by life's pitfalls and threats\nBut really in sniper mode like a nomad noticing life slowly float past\nNo cash, your money is worthless credit is currently all we have to work with\n\n[Chorus: Mary Elizabeth Winstead]\n\n[Verse 2]\nAt the starship repair facility\nyou can see the shipyards with crafts ready to lift off\nCorporations went bankrupt once our planet was assaulted\nwhere their headquarters were posted\nUnable to recover from the losses\nwe were thrown into a recession of monstrous proportions\nAt this point I made my quarters in coma city\nfreelance bounty hunters were plenty\nTrained assassins who aimed and blasted\nat government officials for fame and cash and\nDeltron, I, became known as the starship hijacker\nthroughout the galaxy a mind master\nI would smash the crafts and then sell them\nto the rebel forces in need, for profits and shelter\nA pair of missile launchers might compromise\nthe security of fools who seek my songs demise\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNatural resources nearly depleted to the point that human extinction clearly begins\nBy mankind's folly for all to see within the span of the universe a [?] burstin'\nOur language is in range of heinous threats perpetrated against slaves of sex pets\nThe effect is widespread, you suffer slow; whether you are with the government's corruption or opposed the squad\nYou still go through hard times, that's why Deltron is walking on the war line\nOstracized, but then I got inside; started dissembling the colossal fossil site\nWalls collide when we lob molotovs and pipe bombs to right wrongs\nSlide on to hostile territory, stealth technology, a veil to cloak in, undetected, of where it's broken\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI was a spy, that fly on the wall that no one ever seems to recognize"}}, "Prince Paul f/ Del, Dove (De La Soul)":

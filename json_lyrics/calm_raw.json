me a question\nand raise your eyebrow\nlike when we were looking up at the stars\nand you'd ask me what am I thinking about right now\nyou wanted to change the world\nbut you never wanted to change yourself\nyou just wanted to give me a hug every time you hurt me\nlust is a sexually transmitted disease and love is herpes\nkeep lighting up your cigarettes\nand ill keep this fire lit in my eyes\ncause it's hard for hate to go cold turkey\n\nevery night I look up at the stars\nclose my eyes and cringe\nonly to open them up and see you off in the distance\nstill holding that same fucken syringe\n\nwake me up when it's over\ngive me a kiss on the cheek and hold my hand\nfly with me to the milky way\nwhere our thoughts can stay sober\nand everything can unfold as planned\n\nI find it

storm\n(Time)\nchavo was in the passenger seat\nhis temper was a little warm\n\nI used to hate everyone\nnow I say fuck everyone\nthey're either patronizers or liers\nstrapping me to the stake\nwith their handshakes fueling the fire\nthey like to smile but they're all deceivers\nthey'll promise company then be the first to leave ya\nbut along the way we've met a few believers, bless em all\nI promise you'll be on the guest list\nwith front row seats on the bleachers\nyou supported us\never since we dedicated our lives to speakers\nI tried to be one but kept blowing em out\nplus I couldnt hear what I was saying\ncause the monitors never work, so I'm sorry if I shout\nI'm not really mad, just pissed off\nwe made a couple goals but still having trouble\nwith crossing the checklist off\nI've seen bad knees, lung surgeries and tour poverty\nbut I don't give a fuck, I just cough it off\n\nyou were right, were underground cause we suck\n5 years later AwareNess and Time still not signed\nor giving 3 fucks\nwhen is the non existent calm album coming out they say\nbut before speaking for others ambitions\naccomplish something for yourself that day\nthey say its all about getting drunk and smoking weed\nbut I'm sick of watching people's nose bleed\nlovers cheat, and girls waking up to find out about an\nunexpected pregnancy (baby just cough it off)\n\nwhen they lost me, I found myself\nnow they wonder why I don't party anymore\nI got a party in my soul, its called music\nI got an after party in my heart, it's called love\nbring on the juice and cookies ima write this next song in\n\nblood\nlet me eat now, cause I know the worms'll eat me later\ngo ahead and stab me at the next show\nyou'll be doing our record sales a favor\nI don't really know what fame is, but I wouldnt mind being\n\nrich\nI respect women a cowards the only I refer to as a bitch\nand I hate people who talk shit\nand say they're just joking\nthey're so full of it I'm surprised their tonsils arent choking\n\nyou're right, we're independent cause we're not good enough\nto be on a label\nbut time's have changed\ninstead of ripping up contracts\nI simply delete em in my e-mail\nI'm sick of battling everyone's cousin\nevery emcee thinks they're the best\nI used to think that too until I found out I wasnt\neveryone else wants to put you in a category\nand tell you whats wrong with you\nbut all I can say is shut the fuck up\nand let the song do what it do\n\nthis is AwareNess, his soul speaks through beats and drums\nI go by Time the one who fights with his tongue\nand if we ever stop doing what we love\ngo ahead and pull the trigger twice on your gun\nthis is for your Anti-Smiles\nyour depression and fear\nthis is Calm. a pill in your ear\ndont worry we'll probably

taking steroids to improve my performance \nIf you are what you eat then I'm half cooped up chicken mixed with clone cow\nIt used to be rub sticks for fire and farm with stone plows \nNow it's stoned yuppies who go to grocery stores\nAnd buy anything they need from the clerk with tattooed eyebrow\nIf you can relate to this that's great\nIf you cant it's probably because I'm fake contrived ignorant and pretentious \nEither way I got something to say and insides the parenthesis it reads relentless\nLife isn't a Thomas Kincade painting cause no beautiful paintbrush draws foster homes\nNo one looks like an airbrushed magazine model \nAnd only soap opera characters don't need jobs and a house phone\nThe majority of the population is obese and ugly \nWe're not like those polite people we read about in poems \nWe're not like the polite newscasters who'd rather show numbers for deaths \nInstead of all the blood involved in war and disasters\nWe used to have Indians and trees with trunks \nNow we got businessmen and trees with stumps \nWe got ten years olds wanting to be like daddy \"please can I get drunk?\"\nThey were smoking cigarettes when they 7 and shoplifting by 11\nBut mommy told them you don't want to go to hell be good and you'll go to college\n(not heaven)\ngraduate get a family\nwait a month till you get divorced then repeat the process\nin the meantime you go to

fairytale and Walt Disney isn't drawing me\nThings aren't always what they seem\nCause even the pope has wet dreams\nI'm from America this is where TV and hand gun deaths started at\nHello and welcome to the home of the Big Mac \nQuarter pounded and teenage heart attack\nDon't talk to me just give me pills and chemicals till you fix the problem\nLet my pupils dilate till I can no longer see\nCause my history told me, death is the cure for all disease\nNow days if animals talk to you then you're a schitzo\nBut not every Indian is red and not every white man is a lumberjack with a zippo\nNor does every dreaded man sing calypso (buc buc)\ndrop an anvil on my head and I die\nthen watch a confused mob gather round and stand still on their cell phones\nlooking for a helicopter in the sky \ntell me who you live with and ill tell you what drugs you do\nsleeping beauty wasn't sleeping, she was in a coma \nand when you got shot your head doesn't spin \nand when you get hit with a mallet you don't get a lump\nyou get death\nwhen you born, no one said once upon time \nthere's no such thing as happy ending \njust murder rap, holocaust and an occasional lynch \nand no kiss in the world is gonna wake the dead or turn a toad into a prince\nit's either love or fear\nthey say the world's divided between good and evil but it's not that simple\ncause both sides think they're right and kill anyone who wants to oppose \njust to give their citizens dimples\nthey told me to use my imagination so I imagined a nation \nFree of brainwashing radio and television stations \nEverything has a purpose the media's job is to deceive \nYou are god, bleed for what you love\nClose your eyes, smell the flowers and breathe\nFind happiness in your delusions and just believe\n\nFind happiness in your denial and just smile\n\n(AwareNess)\nChim Chim ma ne\nChim Chim ma ne \nChim Chim Charu\n\n(Time)\nKeep hope alive cause the rest of us are dead\nI got a god and a church and they're both in my head\nMy heart

reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles\nCheating and not beating, the crowd I kept seating\nBut weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating\nStyles that kept them full of bull\n'Cause the vocals

Is the way to go, they know\nOthers say rhymes was failed to be original\nOr they kill where the Hip-Hop starts\nForget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts\nCause some musicians cuss at home\nBut scared to use profanity when upon the microphone\nYeah, they want reality, but you will hear none\nThey'd rather exaggerate a little fiction\nSome say NO! to drugs, and take a stand\nBut after the show, they go looking for the Dopeman (DOPEMAN!!)\nOr they ban my group from the Radio\nHear N.W.A. and say Hell No!\nBut you know it ain't all about wealth\nAs long as you make a note to.. \n\n[Chorus: DJ Yella]\nExpress yourself!!

just to fade ya\nWhores left behind, keep blowing up my pager\nAnd it's a freaky scene, chains and whips\nOnly bring the squeaky clean tricks that came to mix with Tha Liks\nThe authentic, Indo is scented\nLimo, windows tinted, so you can't see who's in it\nThere's no limit to how many mics get tore a minute\nIf the party's cracking then I'm in it\n\n[Chorus: Bud'da X2]\nWe got the party locked down, what you wanna do?\nLadies wanna dance, homies do too\nDon't even bring a strap to this\nKing Tee'll make you clap to this\n\nWord up, y'all  -----&gt; Quote from a previous record\n\n[King Tee]\nNow, you're rolling with the King\nFlossing with no flaws in the ring\nTossing to leave jaws in a sling, often\nThe scrilla peeler, cabbage clutcher, kitty luster\nTiny toucher, not a buster, hustler\nRush the dancefloor, see a whore\nThat make me wanna \"Be The One With You\" like Usher\nPlus the cluster, the type black in the bar back was cool\nThe front and the back was cool\nSo we do, Cognac for two\nThat make the King wanna Act A Fool (remember that?)\nPlayer haters hot, cause I got more gold than Willie Gault and them\nI ain't faulting them, but let's talk about sex like Salt and them\nI won't end, you won't gain, let's not pretend\nI'll get the party hot like the cops walked on your blocks (What's up?)\nCause King Tee got it locked\n\n[Chorus: X2]\n\n[King Tee]\nSome of y'all still don't know what King means, it means ruler\nCastle dweller, old schooler with the wine cellar\nAnd a drawbridge, my troops got you crew hostage\nWhile I'm getting head at their grapes and sausage\nY'all kids wanna know how the boss lives?\nCrib, saucy like ribs, and I got first dibs\nSoon as you crack the bottle, toss it back 'til it's hollow\nMackin' everything from hoodrats to supermodels\nNever subtle, save your rebuttal\nYou couldn't get play in a huddle\nSo ladies tell your man tonight, you can't tonight\nHe gotta use his hand tonight, I guess I planned it right\nWe can smash out in the glass house\nHit the hotel, pull the cash out\nI'll hit it 'til you pass out, then slide back to the spot\nCause Aftermath and King Tee got it locked, yeah!!\n\n[Chorus: X4]\n\n[Outro]\nWe gotta get in to you, aww wweee\nWe gotta get in to you, aww wweee\nWe gotta get in to you, aww wweee\nWe gotta get in to you, aww wweee\nWe gotta get in to you, aww wweee\nWe gotta get in to you, aww wweee\nWe gotta get in to you, aww wweee"}}, "N.W.A. f/ Above the Law, Kokane": {"Efil4zaggin": {"Prelude": "\n[Dr. Dre]\nThe motherfucking saga continues...\n\n[Km.G and Cold
